Installation
------------

To use QMETTS, first install It via Anaconda. You can create an environment with all the packages needed for simulations:

.. code-block:: console

   (base) $ conda env create -f environment.yml

Then activate the environment: 

.. code-block:: console

   (base) $ conda activate QMETTS_env
    
Algorithm
---------

.. autoclass:: library.QMETTS
Here some technicalities on the algorithm will be explained. I have to write the ref to see all the docscript of the functions.
