# QITE for QMETTS
Implementation of QITE algorithm as a subroutine for thermal state preparation. That was the step 1, which succeded (although there are different ways of implementation that we can address).

Step 2 is the implementation of QMETTS for thermal averages of observables of interest. (Done!)

# Variational Gibbs State preparation (Consiglio algorithm)

Step 1 is the implementation of the algorithm for the statevector case (Done)

Step 2 is the study of the noise (Addressing)
